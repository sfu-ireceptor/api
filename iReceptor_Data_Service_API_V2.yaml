        This service returns metadata about samples, including higher-level
        meta-data around the study, subject, diagnosis, and sample processing
        (data relevant to MiAIRR data classes 1 through 3). The data
        returned is filtered based on the parameters provided.

        A successful call returns a json list with a sample level summary of
        each sample including a summary count of the number of sequences found for
        that sample.
